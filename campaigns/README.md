# Campaigns

This module is for short-running, specific campaigns that we are running. The
first example of this was an "Extended Classes Pack" which was shown after a
user selected an emotion if they hadn't seen it yet and there was a class within
the pack for that emotion that they hadn't seen the variations of yet
